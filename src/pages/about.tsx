                    <p>
                        We aim to simplify urban transport by providing accurate, reliable, and
                        affordable route information, helping commuters save time and money while
                        navigating Lagos and beyond.

                    <h2>Why We Built This</h2>
                    <p>
                        Living in a city like Lagos can be overwhelming, especially when it comes
                        to moving around affordably. OptiRoute Naija was born from our own strugglesâ€”
                        standing at bus stops confused, overpaying for routes, and wishing there was
                        a "Google Maps" for local transport.
